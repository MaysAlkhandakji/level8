        of innovation and engineering. Eureka is considered the first academy in 
        Jordan and the Arab world to develop the innovative capabilities of children 
        in the areas of technology and engineering. Eureka teaches children the basic

        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
        consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word 
        in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
        
        <p class="A">Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum 
        et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
        This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. 
        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
